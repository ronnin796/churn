# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

Predict customer churn using machine learning on a real-world Kaggle dataset.

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and building predictive models to identify customers who are likely to leave a service (churn). It demonstrates the complete ML workflow using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for subscription-based businesses. By identifying at-risk customers early, companies can take proactive steps to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.

This repository includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Experiments and testing using Jupyter notebooks
